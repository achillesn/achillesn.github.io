Searching for little Prince's vanished author.</p>

<p>What excites me most, is the sense of uncertainty the photographic action gives. <br>
Time restrictions  make me more aware. <br>
I observe,  I  make choices and I capture. <br>
So the actual action, links me to Here and Now. A link one can follow for gaining  spontaneity. The apparatus gives me the possibility to visualize the feeling. <br>
In photography, If you master the techical details then you liberate your intuition. </p>

<p>Gradually through "searching", I felt that at last I've met Antonin de-Saint Exupéry somewhere among reflexes and shadows, waiting for this unique opportunity to guide me to the core of  photographic experience.</p>

The results of this research was the spark that gave me the idea to try and grasp the functionality of abstraction. It was then, that I started building the  pictures of the installation ”Secret Places” (1996).</p>

<p>The next step was an effort to discover the secret nature of abstraction in photography. At this level, the image of the world as we know it disappears completely into two-dimensionality. Through the de-construction of the image, the chosen themes become ”archetypes”. Those archetypes cannot be perceived by pure intellect any more. They become imaginary objects. They can transfer the spectator to a fictional world. Words are not necessary, since the image is a powerful substitude.</p>

<p>”Nature I” is a part of the results of this research.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2015/11/NATURE-1.jpg" alt="anikon"></p>

<p>The last step is reconstruction. Building a photogenic object based on the knowledge of the previous research. The abstraction here becomes totally concrete due to the artist's manipulations. The images are left without interpretation. They transform their meaning purely on aesthetic grounds. The absence of recognition of the constructed object doesn't matter anymore. Its mater and meaning can remain a secret of their creator. <br>
Lack of a definite answer is also an answer, until someone finds another…</p>

<p>”Evolution” was the last part of ANIKON research. The whole project finished at the beginning of 1998.</p>
